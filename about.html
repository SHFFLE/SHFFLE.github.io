        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <div>
            I was always very eager to learn as a kid, always looking up whatever caught my fancy, and getting reasonably in-depth with it.
            I was always technically minded, and enjoyed finding out what made things tick, and what rules things ran under.
            I really enjoyed the logic puzzles you’d get in school, or doing new puzzles with a fully logical basis to the rules, like sudoku.
            Even as early as middle school I had a reasonably defined interest in pursuing some kind of technical career -
            at the time my interest was in developing games, specifically, something I’ve always enjoyed.
        </div>
        <div>
            As I got through high school, I of course realized that any technical job would be well-suited to me,
            especially as I gained a greater understanding of computer hardware and basics of how more software worked,
            and started to also appreciate the psychology behind UI and UX a bit more as well.
            Development always seemed like a collection of really interesting puzzles, an intellectual challenge that would constantly be changing.
            I went to UTSA with the idea of pursuing a computer science degree, and then realized that college wasn’t really for me,
            as the various courses on topics I had little interest in or found overly simple bored me. I took a break from that,
            deciding to go to work for a little while, get some general work experience. I ended up working for HEB in the bakery for 3 years,
            and in my time there learned a more of the relationship between a company and their consumer,
            and my curiosity about how everything worked led me to gain a good sense of the big picture, and how that relates down to each individual part.
            After a while, though, I did need a change, to move forward, as work there, while enjoyable enough,
            didn’t provide much intellectual challenge beyond remembering where things were.
        </div>
        <div>
            I wanted a challenge, heard about CodeUp, applied, and was accepted.
            I hope to move on to a job that challenges me to learn more and refine what I’ve learned,
            and where I can understand the business and how my performance affects it, and an environment where I can enjoy coming in.
